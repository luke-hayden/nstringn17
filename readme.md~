# Nanostring analysis

Analysis of three Nanostring datasets from:
Oct 2016
Feb 2017
Nov 2017

Goals:
-Optimise marker set for age discrimination
-Optimise normalisation methods
-Determine the effect of regeneration on molecular age
-Develop method to categorise samples by quality

### Prerequisites

All analysis was performed in RStudio Version 1.0.136, running R version 3.x. 
Packages needed are:

library(ggplot2)
library(rmarkdown)
library(gplots)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(reshape2)
library(scales)
library(ggbiplot)
library(devtools)
library(NanoStringNorm)
library(gtools)

Exact prerequisites depend on script in question. 


### Structure
The following functions are carried out by the following scripts:

import.rmd: import and normalisation of raw data (produces .rdata files which other scripts depend on)
markeropt.rmd: optimise marker set
qual.rmd: examine sample quality
normal.rmd: compare normalisation methods

All raw data is held in folders with .rcc files


## Samples

Nov 2017:
59 samples in total, including: 
Old and young male and female pools
Old male and female individuals
Females at 0, 10 and 20 days after moulting, pools and individuals
Regeneration experiment sets: each pool individual has three samples taken:
Left T4 & T5 limbs at t0 (bef)
Left T4 & T5 limbs at t30, after regeneration (reg)
Right T4 &T5 limbs at t30 (un)

Feb 2017:
24 samples in total

Oct 2016:
24 samples in total
